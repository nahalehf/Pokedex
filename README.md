# Pokedex

DeepLearning_FinalProject includes all the code required for training the classifier, segmentation, and final test. Please start by running the cells one by one. The non-maximum supression is also included in the code. 

SAM_Pokedex includes the tests using SAM for segmentation and the best trained classifier. Please remember to download the vi_h version of SAM from https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git and edit the path to the SAM model in the code. The best classifier, dataset, and test folder also need to be downloaded from this repository.
